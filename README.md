HPNAPY
===========

HPNAPY is a Python3 library to access and interface with HP Network Automation's SOAP API.

This library has bee developed testing against HP Network Automation 2018.11 and greater.

More information on HP Network Automation can be found at ([Micro Focus](https://software.microfocus.com/en-us/products/network-automation/overview)).

=======

## Requirements

This package requires Python 3.4+.

It depends on the following modules:

 requests >= 1.0.0
 zeep >= 3.0.0
 urllib3 >= 1.0.0

## Installing

This package is available through pypi and can be installed using pip.
```
pip install hpnapy
```

## Usage

Here is an example of connecting through the API and retrieving a list of device groups.
```
from hpnapy import NAInterface

# Initialize our interface
hpna = NAInterface("https://foo.bar")
hpna.login('username', 'password')

# Retrieve and iterate a list of device groups
device_groups = hpna.list_device_group()
for entry in device_groups:
    print(entry)

```

We can globally disable SSL verification to prevent errors and messaging. This is not recommended as this is a potential security concern.
```
from hpnapy import NAInterface

# Initialize our interface
hpna = NAInterface("https://foo.bar", ssl_verify=False)

```

In order to filter results, we can pass filter keys as defined in the HPE Network Automation Software (NA) CLI/API Command Reference.

```
from hpnapy import NAInterface

# Initialize our interface
hpna = NAInterface("https://foo.bar")
hpna.login('username', 'password')

# Retrieve and iterate a list of device groups
filtered_devices = hpna.list_device(vendor="Cisco", group="My Cisco Switches Group")
for entry in filtered_devices:
    print(entry)

```

## Exceptions

This library uses its own set of exceptions.

```
hpnapy.exceptions.HPNAConnectionError
hpnapy.exceptions.HPNAQueryParamError
hpnapy.exceptions.HPNAQueryError
```
